Improving the quality of health of India's young population: The Indian Council for Medical Research, in its latest Dietary Guidelines for Indians published in April 2024<sup>15</sup>, estimates that 56.4 per cent of the total disease burden in India is due to unhealthy diets. The report also goes on to observe that the upsurge in the consumption of highly processed foods laden with sugars and fat, coupled with reduced physical activity and limited access to diverse foods, exacerbate micronutrient deficiencies and overweight/obesity problems. Estimates show that the adult obesity rate in India has more than tripled, and the annual rise in children's is the steepest in the world for India, behind Vietnam and Namibia, according to the World Obesity Federation<sup>16</sup>. The National Family Health Survey, 2019-2021 presents a very penetrating portrait of the health status of India's population (Box V.2). If India needs to reap the gains of its demographic dividend, it is critical that its population's health parameters transition towards a balanced and diverse diet.</h2>

<p bbox="[67.6, 311.8, 511.4, 386.5]">Obesity is emerging as a serious concern among India's adult population. According to National Family Health Survey 5 (NFHS-5), the percentage of men facing obesity in the age bracket 18-69 has increased to 22.9 per cent in NFHS-5 from 18.9 per cent in NFHS-4. For women, it has increased from 20.6% (NFHS-4) to 24.0% (NFHS-5). The spatial distribution of India's obesity challenge as per NFHS-5 vis-&agrave;-vis NFHS-4 reveals the following:</p>
