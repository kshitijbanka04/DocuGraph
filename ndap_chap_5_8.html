It is increasingly seen that emerging economies are introducing import restrictions on Chinese goods while accelerating a push for free trade elsewhere to protect their domestic manufacturers.

These protectionist measures directed against Chinese products are emerging due to the threat that the overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is posing to other countries, especially in the EMDEs. China's manufacturing trade surplus has been ballooning since 2019 due to weak domestic demand and expanding industrial capacity. The mismatch between domestic supply and demand in China has widened in the past few years, leading to Chinese companies exploring additional markets overseas. This is leading to prices collapsing globally and driving other national producers out of business, especially in product categories where China dominates. For instance, the poor performance of China's property sector since 2021 created significant overcapacity leading to a collapse in global steel prices, which now puts significant pressure on producers in India, Vietnam, Brazil, and other countries. Estimates show that China's steel product exports are surging again-by 27 per cent so far in 2024-after 35 per cent growth last year.

China's dominance over a large number of product categories creates a risk of economic coercion, where the government restrains access to crucial inputs for political leverage. This is most evident in the case of the export of rare earth and critical minerals which are of high priority in the green transition efforts of countries. China's dominance also has led to monopolistic practices which has considerably limited the space for new entrants to emerge as new manufacturing powers. Recent research by Rhodium Group observes that "The Chinese government can encourage companies to partner together, merge and consolidate, coordinate to gain market shares, raise prices, restrict access to products where they already have substantial market power, or favour domestic firms in their suppliers and client networks."

It is also interesting to note that "while China still needs to import high-tech products from rich industrialized economies, it imports very few low-tech goods, where developing countries would have a comparative advantage. This is largely a result of deliberate policy interventions, which have intensified in recent years."

All these above factors have together played a key role in constraining the manufacturing sector of EMDEs. While EMDEs are resorting to import restrictions as a policy option to deal with the Chinese challenge, it is pertinent to note that some Chinese goods are so cheap that no amount of tariff can reduce their price competitiveness. Further, some Chinese products can move past these restrictions without being noticed since they are packaged in third countries. Meanwhile, China has started retaliating against these import restrictions which has further complicated the manufacturing landscape for EMDEs. For instance, in<p-cutoff></p-cutoff>
