<h1>Medium Term Outlook</h1>
<p>
the Ministry of Skill Development &amp; Entrepreneurship (MSDE) highlights that "as per NSSO, 2011-12 (68th round) report on Status of Education and Vocational Training in India, among persons of age 15-59 years, about 2.2 per cent reported to have received formal vocational training and 8.6 per cent reported to have received non-formal vocational training". The Annual Report further goes on enumerate the challenges in the skilling and entrepreneurship landscape in the country, such as ": (i) Public perception that views skilling as the last option meant for those who have not been able to progress/have opted out of the formal academic system. (ii) Skill development programmes of the Central Government are spread across more than 20 Ministries/Departments without any robust coordination and monitoring mechanism to ensure convergence. (iii) Multiplicity in assessment and certification systems that leads to inconsistent outcomes and causes confusion among the employers. (iv) Paucity of trainers, inability to attract practitioners from industry as faculty. (v) Mismatch between demand and supply at the sectoral and spatial levels. (vi) Limited mobility between skill and higher education programmes and vocational education. (vii) Very low coverage of apprenticeship programmes. (viii) Narrow and often obsolete skill curricula. (ix) Declining labour force participation rate of women. (x) Pre-dominant non-farm, unorganized sector employment with low productivity but no premium for skilling. (xi) Non-inclusion of entrepreneurship in formal education system. (xii) Lack of mentorship and adequate access to finance for start-ups. (xiii) Inadequate impetus to innovation driven entrepreneurship. (xiv) Lack of assured wage premium for skilled people".

<h2>5.15. Tapping the full potential of the agriculture sector:</h2>
<p>
Despite its centrality in India's growth trajectory, the agriculture sector continues to face structural issues that have implications for India's economic growth. The foremost concern confronting the sector pertains to sustaining agriculture growth without letting food price inflation rise beyond acceptable limits while incentivising farmers to raise production.<sup>5</sup> There is also a need to improve price discovery mechanisms for agriculture products, increase efficiency, reduce disguised unemployment, address the fragmentation of landholding, and increase crop diversification, among a host of other issues. All of these call for the upgradation of agricultural technology, the application of modern skills in farm practices, enhancing agricultural marketing avenues, price stabilisation, the adoption of innovation in farming, lowering wastages in the use of fertiliser, water, and other inputs, and improving the agriculture-industry linkages. The chapter on agriculture (Chapter 9) discusses the policies being pursued by the Government to enable agriculture to tap its full potential.

<h2>5.16. Easing the compliance requirements and financing bottlenecks confronting MSMEs:</h2>
<p>
MSMEs have played a key role in defining the economic trajectory of some of the major economies, such as Germany, Switzerland, Canada, China, etc. In India, the Government has been paying focused attention to enabling the MSME sector to occupy the centre stage in India's economic story. However, the sector continues to face extensive regulation and compliance requirements and faces significant bottlenecks with access to affordable and timely funding being one of the core concerns.
