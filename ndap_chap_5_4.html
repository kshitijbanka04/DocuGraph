<b>Sixth</b>, in the last decade (2014-2024), the Government of India has pursued big-ticket reforms focused on restoring the health of the economy, elevating the potential growth by relieving supply-side constraints and strengthening its capabilities, capable of fulfilling the growth aspirations of the people in the present and the Amrit Kaal. The next stage is to ensure that these reforms are implemented correctly and this will require intense engagement with state governments, the private sector, and civil society. <b>Going forward, the Government's focus must turn to bottom-up reform and the strengthening of the plumbing of governance so that the structural reforms of the last decade yield strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.</b>

Based on the state of the play of the Indian economy, both at a macro level and sectoral level, that has been elaborated in the rest of the chapters of this Survey, the present section draws out some of the key areas of policy focus to ensure that India's growth continues unimpeded, crossing the milestone of becoming the third largest economy of the world in short order, on its way to scaling greater heights.

5.13. <b>Generating productive employment:</b> Productive jobs are vital for growth and inclusion. India's workforce is estimated to be nearly 56.5 Crore, of which more than 45 per cent are employed in agriculture, 11.4 per cent in manufacturing, 28.9 per cent in services, and 13.0 per cent in construction<sup>2</sup>. While the services sector remains a major job creator, the construction sector has been rising in prominence lately, driven by the government's push for infrastructure. However, since construction jobs are largely informal and low-paid, there is a need for avenues for the labour force leaving agriculture. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector employment creation has been subdued in the past decade due to the legacy of bad loans and appears to have rebounded since 2021-22. According to UN population projections, India's working-age population (15-59 years) will continue to grow until 2044. The chapter on Employment (chapter 8) estimates that the Indian economy needs to generate nearly 78.51 lakh jobs annually in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising workforce. However, to create these many jobs, there is a need to create the conditions for faster growth of productive jobs outside of agriculture, especially in organized manufacturing and services, even while improving productivity in agriculture.

5.14. <b>Skill gap challenge:</b> Sixty-five per cent of India's fast-growing population is under 35, and many lack the skills needed by a modern economy<sup>3</sup>. Estimates show that about 51.25 per cent of the youth is deemed employable. In other words, about one in two are not yet readily employable, straight out of college. However, it must be noted that the percentage has improved from around 34 per cent to 51.3 per cent in the last decade<sup>4</sup>. The 2022-23 Annual Report of<p-cutoff></p-cutoff>
