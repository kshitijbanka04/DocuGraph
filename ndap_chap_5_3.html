progress. It is required to maintain a constant vigil on its borders both in the Northwest and in the Northeast. With the digitalisation of the Indian economy, cybersecurity assumes a much higher degree of importance and urgency. Therefore, providing financial resources for national security is imperative. Fiscal resources have to increase without compromising on economic growth.

5.9. The capacity in terms of numbers and the capability of the State in terms of competence, skills, and attitude are additional factors that would determine the outcomes of India's economic and social goals. Economic policies have to be crafted in such a manner that they do not address issues narrowly or incompletely while rendering problems in other areas more intractable. Goals for a higher share of renewable power with its implications for land usage and dependence on inimical powers for resources are one example. The impact of farm sector policies on water security is another example.

5.10. With the global backdrop described earlier likely to come in the way of India boosting its exports at the same pace and level as East Asian countries and national security considerations likely to make foreign direct investment flows volatile year-to-year, India has to generate domestic resources mostly for its own investment and growth priorities. Geopolitics imposes its ceiling on external deficit and, consequently, external financing.

<b>First,</b> increasing <b>geoeconomic fragmentation and the consequent resource nationalism have significant growth-limiting impacts</b> on countries. It has given rise to a trade-off between efficiency and resilience that did not exist a decade earlier. Ensuring the security of supply through building buffers and slack has replaced the ability to operate at the frontiers of efficiency. 'Just in case' has replaced 'Just in time'.

<b>Second, a global trust deficit is driving countries to pursue policies focused on enabling them to become self-reliant</b> and protect them from external shocks, especially in sectors of strategic importance. Therefore, the balance between inward-looking policies versus outward-looking policies needs to become more nuanced going forward;

<b>Third, the integration of climate change strategies into national development policy and planning is not merely an environmental imperative but more,</b> as it impacts socio-economic stability, public health, banking, and public finances. Climate change imposes costs and requires policymakers to balance adaptation to climate change and emission mitigation. It also necessitates a trade-off between energy security and economic development on the one hand and energy transition on the other.

<b>Fourth, for better and worse, technology is emerging as the biggest strategic differentiator</b> determining the economic prosperity of nations. Its productivity-enhancing potential is beyond doubt, but the social impact of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) via labour market disruptions and labour displacement is barely understood. It also has the potential to skew the capital and labour shares of income in favour of the former.
