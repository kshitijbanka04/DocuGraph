5.3. Today, the world faces several major fault lines. We have arrived at a multipolar world. It is more difficult than the bipolar world that we were used to for nearly five decades after the War ended. Therefore, mini and significant geopolitical conflicts are likely in the coming decades.

5.4. At a cultural level, the rise of what is called the 'Far Right' by mainstream media in advanced nations is, in effect, a clash of priorities between globalist elites and others whose fortunes are bound by and tied to their national geographies. This clash of priorities transcends economics. It includes cultural and social preferences and values. Therefore, along with economic stagnation and geopolitical conflicts, societies in advanced nations are fracturing from within, too. The literature analysing long political, social, and civilisational cycles has warned us of a fairly to severely turbulent three decades until the middle of the century.

5.5. The idea of economic globalisation has run its course. It may not be reversed fully, but it has peaked. It will continue to face obstacles as economic policies worldwide pivot to the promotion of national champions for reasons too well-known to bear repetition here. Along with the peaking of globalisation, there is also a rethinking of the role of government in national economic strategy as inequality, poverty, and indebtedness have become pressing issues in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic. The clamour for easy answers to these global and generational challenges has provided an excuse for interventionist policies despite their poor empirical record in achieving prosperous or more equal societies.

5.6. Lastly, there is the crisis posed by climate change and global warming. Developed countries are pushing for a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. With their policies having questionable effectiveness in achieving emission reduction in their own countries, they are ramping up pressure on developing nations. Developing nations are struggling to restore economic growth and reduce poverty and debt in their countries, all of which have been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. They lack both technology and financial resources to undertake the necessary transition to cleaner fuels. Developed nations are generous with pledges and parsimonious in delivering on them. Further, there are huge uncertainties as to the efficacy of drastic measures to combat climate change and their economic impact over the next half to a full decade. Slower growth, stagnation, or outright contraction might trigger social unrest and exodus of people to the West.

5.7. This is the global backdrop to India's growth, prosperity, and superpower aspirations for the next quarter century. In contrast, during its rise, China did not face many of these challenges, and even the ones they faced were fairly milder, in comparison. For realising India's aspirations, despite the changed circumstances, a good place to start is to acknowledge and recognise that the terrain has changed to be able to traverse through it and reach the destination.

<p bbox="[60.0, 643.2, 518.7, 728.9]">
5.8. India has to sustain its economic growth rate over a quarter century and do it sustainably, keeping the environment and climate in mind. Water stress looms large, as does air pollution. Life expectancy, much higher now than in the past, has stagnated in recent years. It has to educate and skill its youth to stay ahead of the curve so that they can work with emerging technologies while overcoming the accumulated education and skill deficits, accentuated by the pandemic, that make it harder to raise productivity even with the current state of technological
