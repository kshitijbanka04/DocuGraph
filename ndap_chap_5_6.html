that MSMEs have to deal with, imposed particularly by sub-national governments, hold them back from growing to their potential and being job creators of substance. Threshold-based concessions and exemptions create the unintended effect of incentivising enterprises to cap their sizes below the thresholds. Therefore, threshold-based incentives must have sunset clauses. Further, many MSMEs struggle to secure the necessary funds to start, operate, or expand their business due to a variety of reasons including lack of collateral or credit history, high interest rates, complex documentation requirements, and long processing times, etc. The Lok Sabha Standing Committee on Finance, in its April 2022 report on 'Strengthening Credit Flows to the MSME, noted that the credit gap in the MSME sector is estimated to be around Rs 20-25 lakh crore. The government has launched several schemes, such as the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises, aimed at providing affordable credit to MSMEs. The initiatives have shown considerable promise in addressing these challenges. The Chapter on Industry (Chapter 10) discusses these issues in detail.

<h2>5.17. Managing India's green transition:</h2>
<p>
India has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 33-35 per cent (from 2005 levels), increasing the share of non-fossil fuel-based electricity to 40 per cent and enhancing forest cover to absorb 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030<sup>6</sup>. However, the path of green transition in India needs to (a) ensure the consistency of the E-Mobility policy with the required and optimal energy mix between traditional and renewable source; (b) ensure grid stability for E-Mobility to become pervasive; (c) develop or acquire storage technology at affordable costs for the share of renewable energy in power generation to rise; (d) reckon with the opportunity cost of land and capital being used for renewable energy given that India's needs for land and capital far exceed their availability; (e) decide on the role and the share of nuclear energy in the energy mix; (f) recognise and deal with challenges posed by dependence on China for critical minerals, which are crucial raw materials needed for E-Mobility and renewable energy generation; (g) examine the implications of phasing down coal for bank balance sheets; (h) recognise and estimate the impact of phasing out of coal-fired thermal plants on the freight revenues of the Indian Railways and (i) study implications of replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with e-vehicles particularly on the sale of petrol and diesel and the tax revenues that such sale generates for the Union and State governments. Last but not least, India not only has to deal with climate change and undertake energy transition but also deal with the protectionism of the developed countries. Europe is on course to implement its Carbon Border Adjustment Tax and both the United Kingdom and the United States are in different stages of imposing their versions of it in due course. These taxes are in contravention to the spirit of the Paris Agreement that recognised 'Common But Differentiated Responsibilities'.
