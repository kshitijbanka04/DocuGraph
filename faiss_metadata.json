The structural reforms undertaken by the Government of India since 2014 have put the economy firmly on a growth path, and India is soon set to become the third-largest economy in the world. In the medium term, the Indian economy can grow at a rate of 7 per cent plus on a sustained basis if we can build on the structural reforms undertaken over the last decade. Against this backdrop, the chapter identifies the areas of key policy focus as well as presents a six-pronged growth strategy to achieve this goal. The strategy elucidated in the chapter is premised on the understanding that the structural reforms of the last decade, focused on the supply side of the economy, have to give way to next-gen reforms that are bottom-up in nature to yield strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.",

While the services sector remains a major job creator, the construction sector has been rising in prominence lately, driven by the government's push for infrastructure. However, since construction jobs are largely informal and low-paid, there is a need for avenues for the labour force leaving agriculture. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector employment creation has been subdued in the past decade due to the legacy of bad loans and appears to have rebounded since 2021-22. According to UN population projections, India's working-age population (15-59 years) will continue to grow until 2044. The chapter on Employment (chapter 8) estimates that the Indian economy needs to generate nearly 78.51 lakh jobs annually in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising workforce.

Further, many MSMEs struggle to secure the necessary funds to start, operate, or expand their business due to a variety of reasons including lack of collateral or credit history, high interest rates, complex documentation requirements, and long processing times, etc. The Lok Sabha Standing Committee on Finance, in its April 2022 report on 'Strengthening Credit Flows to the MSME, noted that the credit gap in the MSME sector is estimated to be around Rs 20-25 lakh crore. The government has launched several schemes, such as the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises, aimed at providing affordable credit to MSMEs. The initiatives have shown considerable promise in addressing these challenges. The Chapter on Industry (Chapter 10) discusses these issues in detail.",

However, the path of green transition in India needs to (a) ensure the consistency of the E-Mobility policy with the required and optimal energy mix between traditional and renewable source; (b) ensure grid stability for E-Mobility to become pervasive; (c) develop or acquire storage technology at affordable costs for the share of renewable energy in power generation to rise; (d) reckon with the opportunity cost of land and capital being used for renewable energy given that India's needs for land and capital far exceed their availability; (e) decide on the role and the share of nuclear energy in the energy mix; (f) recognise and deal with challenges posed by dependence on China for critical minerals, which are crucial raw materials needed for E-Mobility and renewable energy generation; (g) examine the implications of phasing down coal for bank balance sheets; (h) recognise and estimate the impact of phasing out of coal-fired thermal plants on the freight revenues of the Indian Railways and (i) study implications of replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with e-vehicles particularly on the sale of petrol and diesel and the tax revenues that such sale generates for the Union and State governments. Last but not least, India not only has to deal with climate change and undertake energy transition but also deal with the protectionism of the developed countries. Europe is on course to implement its Carbon Border Adjustment Tax and both the United Kingdom and the United States are in different stages of imposing their versions of it in due course. These taxes are in contravention to the spirit of the Paris Agreement that recognised 'Common But Differentiated Responsibilities'.",
