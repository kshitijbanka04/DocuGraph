<p bbox="[67.7, 75.2, 511.4, 160.9]">response the India's anti-dumping probe against Chinese entities, China has been quietly blocking India's access to solar equipment. Given this, dealing with the Chinese manufacturing juggernaut will test the policy mettle of EMDEs. Developing countries will have to figure out a way of meeting the import competition from China and, at the same time, boosting domestic manufacturing capabilities, sometimes with the collaboration of Chinese investment and technology.</p>
<p bbox="[67.5, 173.0, 511.5, 211.4]">As the Rhodium group research points out, Brazil and Turkey recently raised tariffs on the import of E-Vehicles from China but, at the same time, took steps to attract Chinese FDI in the sector.</p>
<p bbox="[67.8, 228.0, 511.4, 296.6]">India has a similar decision to make, given its large bilateral trade deficit with China. It makes India vulnerable to potential abrupt supply disruptions. Replacing some well-chosen imports with investments from China raises the prospect of creating domestic know-how down the road. It may have other risks, but as with many other matters, we don't live in a first-best world. We have to choose between second and third-best choices.</p>
<p bbox="[67.9, 313.0, 511.4, 366.5]">In sum, to boost Indian manufacturing and plug India into the global supply chain, it is inevitable that India plugs itself into China's supply chain. Whether we do so by relying solely on imports or partially through Chinese investments is a choice that India has to make.</p>

Deepening the corporate bond market: Going forward, the investment needed to steer India's economic growth has to be through a multitude of financing options beyond bank financing. India needs both banks and capital markets to provide the required finances sourced from a sustained high level of household savings. An active corporate bond market becomes critical in this context. An efficient corporate bond market with lower costs and quicker issuing time can offer an efficient and cost-effective source of longer-term funds for corporates. However, the size of the corporate bond market in India, scaled by GDP, remains small compared to other major Asian emerging markets such as Malaysia, Korea, and China.<sup>13</sup> The Indian corporate bond market lacks depth since it is dominated by highly-rated issuers and a limited investor base of domestic institutions.</h2>
<h2 bbox="[60.0, 552.2, 518.6, 696.2]">5.21. Tackling inequality: Globally, widening inequality is emerging as a crucial economic challenge confronting policymakers. The 2022 State of Inequality in India report<sup>14</sup> observed that in India, the top 1 per cent accounts for 6-7 per cent of the total incomes earned, while the top 10 per cent accounts for one-third of total incomes earned. The Government places significant focus on this issue and all the critical policy interventions being undertaken with a focus on creating jobs, integrating the informal sector with the formal sector, and expanding the female labour force are aimed at effectively addressing inequality. Tax policies on the treatment of capital and labour incomes will likely play a more important role in the coming years, especially since the deployment of technology like AI may have a more deleterious impact on employment and income.</h2>
