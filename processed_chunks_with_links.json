The structural reforms undertaken by the Government of India since 2014 have put the economy firmly on a growth path, and India is soon set to become the third-largest economy in the world. In the medium term, the Indian economy can grow at a rate of 7 per cent plus on a sustained basis if we can build on the structural reforms undertaken over the last decade. Against this backdrop, the chapter identifies the areas of key policy focus as well as presents a six-pronged growth strategy to achieve this goal. The strategy elucidated in the chapter is premised on the understanding that the structural reforms of the last decade, focused on the supply side of the economy, have to give way to next-gen reforms that are bottom-up in nature to yield strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.",

Developing nations are struggling to restore economic growth and reduce poverty and debt in their countries, all of which have been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. They lack both technology and financial resources to undertake the necessary transition to cleaner fuels. Developed nations are generous with pledges and parsimonious in delivering on them.

While the services sector remains a major job creator, the construction sector has been rising in prominence lately, driven by the government's push for infrastructure. However, since construction jobs are largely informal and low-paid, there is a need for avenues for the labour force leaving agriculture. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector employment creation has been subdued in the past decade due to the legacy of bad loans and appears to have rebounded since 2021-22. According to UN population projections, India's working-age population (15-59 years) will continue to grow until 2044. The chapter on Employment (chapter 8) estimates that the Indian economy needs to generate nearly 78.51 lakh jobs annually in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising workforce. However, to create these many jobs, there is a need to create the conditions for faster growth of productive jobs outside of agriculture, especially in organized manufacturing and services, even while improving productivity in agriculture.",

(iii) Multiplicity in assessment and certification systems that leads to inconsistent outcomes and causes confusion among the employers. (iv) Paucity of trainers, inability to attract practitioners from industry as faculty. (v) Mismatch between demand and supply at the sectoral and spatial levels. (vi) Limited mobility between skill and higher education programmes and vocational education. (vii) Very low coverage of apprenticeship programmes. (viii) Narrow and often obsolete skill curricula. (ix) Declining labour force participation rate of women. (x) Pre-dominant non-farm, unorganized sector employment with low productivity but no premium for skilling.

The Chinese domination over the global supply chains across product categories is a key global concern, especially in the wake of supply disruption accompanying the war in Ukraine. Even though India is the fastest-growing G20 country and is now recording growth rates that outpace China's, India's economy is still a fraction of China's. In the context of energy transition, China's near-monopoly over the production and processing of critical and rare earth minerals has already been a cause of global concern. It will also have significant repercussions for India's renewable energy programme, which is vulnerable because of its massive dependence on imported raw materials 11 . Against this background, it may notbe the most prudent approach to think that India can take up the slack from China vacating certain spaces in manufacturing. Indeed, recent data cast doubt on whether China is even vacating light manufacturing. The questions that India faces are: (a) Is it possible to plug India into the global supply chain without plugging itself into the China supply chain? and (b) what is the right balance between importing goods and importing capital from China?

China's manufacturing trade surplus has been ballooning since 2019 due to weak domestic demand and expanding industrial capacity. The mismatch between domestic supply and demand in China has widened in the past few years, leading to Chinese companies exploring additional markets overseas. This is leading to prices collapsing globally and driving other national producers out of business, especially in product categories where China dominates. For instance, the poor performance of China's property sector since 2021 created significant overcapacity leading to a collapse in global steel prices, which now puts significant pressure on producers in India, Vietnam, Brazil, and other countries. Estimates show that China's steel product exports are surging again-by 27 per cent so far in 2024-after 35 per cent growth last year.",

While EMDEs are resorting to import restrictions as a policy option to deal with the Chinese challenge, it is pertinent to note that some Chinese goods are so cheap that no amount of tariff can reduce their price competitiveness. Further, some Chinese products can move past these restrictions without being noticed since they are packaged in third countries. Meanwhile, China has started retaliating against these import restrictions which has further complicated the manufacturing landscape for EMDEs. For instance, in",

An efficient corporate bond market with lower costs and quicker issuing time can offer an efficient and cost-effective source of longer-term funds for corporates. However, the size of the corporate bond market in India, scaled by GDP, remains small compared to other major Asian emerging markets such as Malaysia, Korea, and China. 13 The Indian corporate bond market lacks depth since it is dominated by highly-rated issuers and a limited investor base of domestic institutions.",

Improving the quality of health of India's young population: The Indian Council for Medical Research, in its latest Dietary Guidelines for Indians published in April 2024 15 , estimates that 56.4 per cent of the total disease burden in India is due to unhealthy diets. The report also goes on to observe that the upsurge in the consumption of highly processed foods laden with sugars and fat, coupled with reduced physical activity and limited access to diverse foods, exacerbate micronutrient deficiencies and overweight/obesity problems. Estimates show that the adult obesity rate in India has more than tripled, and the annual rise in children's is the steepest in the world for India, behind Vietnam and Namibia, according to the World Obesity Federation 16 . The National Family Health Survey, 2019-2021 presents a very penetrating portrait of the health status of India's population (Box V.2). If India needs to reap the gains of its demographic dividend, it is critical that its population's health parameters transition towards a balanced and diverse diet.",

For women, it has increased from 20.6% (NFHS-4) to 24.0% (NFHS-5). The spatial distribution of India's obesity challenge as per NFHS-5 vis-\u00e0-vis NFHS-4 reveals the following: In Tamil Nadu, for men, it is 37.0% (vs. 28.2% in NFHS-4), and it is 40.4% for women (vs. 30.9% in NFHS-4). In Uttar Pradesh, for women, it has gone up to 21.3% (NFHS-5) from 16.5% (NFHS-4), and for men, it has gone up to 18.5% (NFHS-5) from 12.5% (NFHS-4).
