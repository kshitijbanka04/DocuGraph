Raising financial resources for climate change adaptation and mitigation actions of this scale is an unprecedented challenge, especially given that India's climate action has been largely financed through domestic resources and the flow of international finance has been very limited. As per the Reserve Bank of India, bridging this substantial funding gap necessitates allocating 2.5 per cent of India's annual GDP to green finance. A 2022 report by the Climate Policy Initiative<sup>8</sup> found that domestic sources accounted for the majority of green finance in India, at 87 per cent and 83 per cent in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively. While international sources are increasing (from 13 per cent in FY 2019 to 17 per cent in FY 2020), they are still insufficient to meet India's net-zero target<sup>9</sup>.</p>
<p bbox="[60.0, 207.0, 518.7, 372.7]">Mobilising substantial capital from traditional sources presents multifaceted challenges in emerging economies like India. The perceived sovereign risks associated with EMDEs and the capital-intensive nature of such projects, coupled with lengthy gestation periods and evolving regulatory frameworks, can create misalignment between investor expectations and project timelines. It is also pertinent to note that the flows of global capital to developing countries have been impeded by high costs of capital. Despite securing a good rating on its green bond framework, Indian sovereign green bonds have hardly received any 'greenium'<sup>10</sup> from private investors. It is more a 'wall of capital' than a 'flood of capital' that is waiting to fund energy transition in EMDEs. It just isn't mobile. All of these together have severely hampered the flow of finance for green transition projects. The issues related to climate finance and India's green transition are discussed in detail in the chapter on Climate Change and Energy (chapter 6).</p>

The Chinese domination over the global supply chains across product categories is a key global concern, especially in the wake of supply disruption accompanying the war in Ukraine. Even though India is the fastest-growing G20 country and is now recording growth rates that outpace China's, India's economy is still a fraction of China's. In the context of energy transition, China's near-monopoly over the production and processing of critical and rare earth minerals has already been a cause of global concern. It will also have significant repercussions for India's renewable energy programme, which is vulnerable because of its massive dependence on imported raw materials<sup>11</sup>. Against this background, it may notbe the most prudent approach to think that India can take up the slack from China vacating certain spaces in manufacturing. Indeed, recent data cast doubt on whether China is even vacating light manufacturing. The questions that India faces are: (a) Is it possible to plug India into the global supply chain without plugging itself into the China supply chain? and (b) what is the right balance between importing goods and importing capital from China? As countries attempt to reshore and friendshore, India's policy choices concerning China are exacting.</h1>
